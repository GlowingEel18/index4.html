<h2>Problem statement: Troubleshooting a Calculator program</h2>
<p>
[Troubleshooting a calculator program that always runs into errors that the user doesn’t understand and tries to fix the program but always runs into syntax errors, so for the user to fix the program the user can only fix the javascript code that allows the program to work.
 Once that is finalized, then the checks for any problems in the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to see if there are any errors in any of the files if not, the program will work perfectly.]
